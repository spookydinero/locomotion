Software Solution for Locomotion – Comprehensive Overview

Locomotion operates a uniquely complex business structure: multiple automotive shops, a transmission parts business, used car sales, and cross-border operations in both the U.S. and Mexico. To support growth, enforce discipline, and prepare for franchising, the software solution we are building must unify daily operations while respecting strict legal and accounting separation between entities.

At its core, the platform will provide a consolidated management system that brings together workflows currently spread across Tekmetric, QuickBooks, Zoho, Inflow, and multiple Excel dashboards. Rather than relying on inconsistent data entry and manual reconciliation, the new system will centralize repair orders (ROs), parts inventory, invoices, warranties, and employee productivity in a single environment. This will allow the owner to see daily KPIs across all shops on his phone, while still producing legally siloed financials for each entity.

A critical element is QR code integration, ensuring accountability on the shop floor. Each vehicle will be tagged with a QR code when it enters the facility, enabling technicians to log phases of work directly from a tablet. The QR scan will link the car to its bay, the technician assigned, the tasks performed, and supporting photos or audio notes. This eliminates confusion over misplaced vehicles, keys, or parts, and provides a timestamped digital trail of every movement. For lifts, QR tracking will not only show availability but also highlight overruns, helping management understand real-time utilization of shop capacity.

The platform will be tablet-ready by design. Each technician will be issued a low-cost tablet where they can scan vehicle codes, upload required photos, confirm completed steps, and receive job assignments. Compliance will be embedded into the workflow: a job cannot advance to the next phase without required documentation. This ensures consistency and builds the data foundation for AI modules.

On the inventory side, the system will replace scattered spreadsheets with a structured parts and core tracking module. This includes real-time stock levels, reorder alerts, and optional QR/RFID tagging. Core returns will be tracked automatically against invoices, ensuring credits are not lost. Theft and losses will be flagged by discrepancy reports, reducing one of Locomotion’s current pain points.

Artificial Intelligence will be woven throughout the platform. A diagnostic assistant will analyze error codes and repair histories to suggest steps, parts, or relevant service bulletins. Image recognition will allow parts or assemblies to be identified from photos, reducing misorders. Predictive analytics will highlight high-risk warranties or technician productivity issues before they become costly. A vendor price comparison engine will provide cost transparency for purchasing decisions.

Externally, the system will power a redesigned, conversion-driven website. Each business entity will have its own dedicated section, linked under the Locomotion umbrella. Fleet and retail customers will be able to submit leads or even create preliminary ROs directly from the site. In the future, clients may track the progress of their repair through the same QR-linked system, with updates delivered via SMS or portal.

Together, these components create a franchise-ready platform: standardized processes, digitized compliance, AI-powered insights, and customer-facing transparency. Locomotion will gain tighter control of operations, higher productivity from technicians, more reliable financial reporting, and the credibility needed to scale to dozens of shops across the U.S. and Mexico.
